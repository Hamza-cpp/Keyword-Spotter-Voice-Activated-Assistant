# **Keyword Spotter: Voice Activated Assistant**

## **Overview**

In this project, we aim to build a voice-activated assistant capable of recognizing and responding to specific keywords or commands using the Google Speech Commands dataset. Voice assistants rely on keyword spotting (KWS) to process users' spoken commands, typically activated by keywords such as "Alexa" or "Ok Google", which must be spotted to activate the voice assistant. This project explores the critical task of keyword spotting through speech recognition, using both machine learning and deep learning techniques. By converting raw audio waveforms into Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), we create features that serve as input to our model, enabling efficient and accurate keyword detection.
